                    <p>MoDaH currently a House producer. This man has been perfecting his art over the past 5 years. Started by learning
                        two programs at once with fruity loops rewired with Reason which gave him a head start from the word go, he had
                        an instant skill for automation which still remains a core for the music he currently makes as he never sticks
                        to one genre of house, this comes down to his love of various music and the thirst of knowledge through people.
                        His strength comes from being open to constructive criticism to help him build, at the same time very confident
                        in the music he makes as MoDaH sets himself apart from other producers and progress to higher levels. In 2015
                        this man is at the most exciting part of his journey, as 6 years  approach of constantly making a wide range of
                        styles have finally come together to make something different with blends of house. It can only progress from here,
                        so keep watch or miss out because this artist will rise quicker than a Phoenix</p>

                        All they want is to enjoy and to enjoy the crowd. This is exactly what strongly emerges during a set of these two guys
                        because it’s not just music for these two gentlemen. It´s a feeling, it’s a vibe and it’s joy.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>They love house music, all kinds of house music, so they had to make a perfect combination of all the styles they love.
                        You can expect different styles, but always with soul-pleasing vocals. One thing is for sure, the music Flo Phielix &
                        Jeff Smink plays is always funky, groovy, refreshing and happy.</p>

                    <p>Jamie has always had a love for technology and all things music, and started writing dance music back in 1988
                    on an Amiga 500.  Experimenting with different genres, from Hardcore to Techno, Ambient to House, he eventually
                    settled on Deep House, which is still his favourite House sub-genre to this day. </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>In 2008, Jamie sent away a demo album to a number of record labels, and got his first EP signed to Alive in Music,
                    a London-based label.  The EP featured two Electro House tracks, and was well received by clubbers and DJ's.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Jamie then took a break from music to concentrate on family and work, and ended up being away from music for almost 6 years.
                    In July 2014, he dusted off his trusty studio equipment and started writing again.  In less than 3 months, he had a
